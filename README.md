I'll help integrate that content into the README.md file while maintaining proper markdown formatting. Here's the complete updated version:

# ConsumeWise: Digital Public Product Information System

## Introduction
The **ConsumeWise DPI** platform is designed to:
- Provide consumers with **detailed, verifiable information** about the health and environmental impact of products.
- Build a **decentralized, open-source repository** of product data for public use.
- Use this data to generate **personalized recommendations** for healthier and more sustainable consumption.

Learn more about the project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0I3DVqe_B-GlaqSRJ3QrwnBO7L6pE1uTZfGo9f7w4xI8Bci5oJl3tpM7oTaRRrE8mzbUfTe3RjVgg/pub).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/ConsumeWise.git
```

### Install Dependencies
Each folder contains a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies. To install them, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need to create a `.env` file with the following keys:
- MONGODB_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY

### Running the Project
1. Each folder is a separate project with its own set of commands. Check each project's `README.md` file for specific instructions.
2. To run the main application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. To launch the Streamlit interface:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Provide clear, high-quality images when using image extraction
3. Include all required fields in request bodies
4. Handle responses appropriately in your application

## Workflow Example
1. Search for product using Find Product endpoint
2. If found, get details using Get Product Details
3. If not found, use Extract Data from Images
4. Process the product info through:
   - Nutrient Analysis
   - Processing Level Analysis
   - Claims Analysis (if claims exist)
5. Generate final analysis using Cumulative Analysis
